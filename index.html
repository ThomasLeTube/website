			<h3><u>League of Legends</u></h3>
			<p class="card-desc"> The best game so far. If you don't have the time to play each one of these games, this is the one you have to choose. Indeed, the constant adaptation and the huge amount of characters makes each game different than the last one ! </p>
		</div>
		<div class="descript" id="valo">
			<h3><u>Valorant</u></h3>
			<p>Really interesting game when you want to test your skills. If you are awake, had some warm up before, this is the perfect game to let the steam off. But be careful, it quickly becomes frustrating so I hope that you are well rage proof !</p>
		</div>
		<div class="descript" id="cs">
			<h3><u>Counter Strike</u></h3>
  			<p>Same as Valorant. This game requires some warm-up before going in competition. The lack of aim quicly becomes a problem as you are getting instant kill by good  players. Even though aim skills and reflexs are important, you need a good strategic sens to succeed. This game is the perfect combination between these 2 elements </p>
		</div>
		<div class="descript" id="minecraft">
			<h3><u>Minecraft</u></h3>
  			<p>The ultimate game for chilling. This game is so peaceful and your possibilities are near infinite. You can do whatever you want whith whoever you want. When you have some time and don't want to play competitive games, this game is the one you should play !</p>
